\begin{abstract}
A three-way, floor standing loudspeaker featuring an active crossover was designed to have a flat frequency response over the majority of the acoustic range. A measured system response from \SIrange{20}{20000}{\hertz} was achieved to a flatness of \SI{\pm 5}{\dB} using minDSPâ€™s UMIK-1 USB microphone.
