Like many projects undertaking stems from a personal curiosity about the subjects herein presented and a fundamental desire to design and build. Only after trying to do something, we learn how woefully incomplete and inaccurate are the writings and descriptions of experts. Despite these limitations, we must aspire to learn from others and, then, from ourselves.\par
