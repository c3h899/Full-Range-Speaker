Passive Filter derived from of 2nd-order Bessel Filter
Response designed with 3-db (f1 = 200 Hz) and (f2 = 2000 Hz)

Tweeter is high-pass
Mid-Bass is band-pass
Sub is low-pass

Frequence and impedance response based on measured (in-situ) data.
Design has not been validated with physical hardware.
